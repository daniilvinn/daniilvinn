# Hi there, I'm Daniil Vinnik!

## My projects
  - [Motus3D][motus3d]: it is game engine I'm working on and currently my main project. It uses Vulkan as its graphics API, targets on rendering 3D meshes with PBR           rendering, has Input system, logging, layer-based architecture and other techniques.
  - [Motus][motus]: it is lightweight version of [Motus3D][motus3d], which uses OpenGL as its graphics API and mainly targets to 2D rendering, integrated with ImGUI         framework for UI rendering, has Input system and 2D camera.

## About me
Born in Verkhivtseve, Ukraine, I used to like computers and video-games from childhood. While I was playing games, I wondered how do they work, and what stands behind it, how exactly my computer can draw all those beautiful landscapes?
When I turned 11, I applied to ItStep Junior Academy, where I have shown excellent result as student.
Later, when I was 15, I decided to enroll to ItStep Academy's Software Engineering Faculty, where I study now concurrently with university.

## My interests
  - Programming and game engines
  - Video-games and gaming
  - Math
  - Physics
  - Karting and racing
  - Formula 1
  - Middle-age history
