# Hi there, I'm Daniil Vinnik!

## My projects
  - [Omniforce][omniforce-engine]: Main project I'm currently working on. It was initially designed for 2D games, but now it has course on implementing full 3D workflow capable of running actual 3D games. It features high-performance 2D renderer, mesh-shader-based 3D renderer with PBR lighting, rigid body dynamics, C#       scripting using Mono, Editor, projects workflow, and Entity-Component System. Currently renderer is under active development. New renderer, designed for 3D (and entire engine in general) is developed in omni2024 branch.
  - [Motus3D][motus3d]: it is a game engine I worked on. It uses Vulkan as its graphics API, targets on rendering 3D meshes with PBR           rendering, has Input system, logging, layer-based architecture and other techniques.
  - [Motus][motus]: it is a lightweight version of [Motus3D][motus3d], which uses OpenGL as its graphics API and mainly targets to 2D rendering, integrated with ImGUI         framework for UI rendering, has Input system and 2D camera.

## About me
Born in Verkhivtseve, Ukraine, I used to like computers and video-games from childhood. While I was playing games, I wondered how do they work, and what stands behind it, how exactly my computer can draw all those beautiful landscapes?
When I turned 11, I applied to ItStep Junior Academy, where I have shown excellent result as student.
Later, when I was 15, I decided to enroll to ItStep Academy's Software Engineering Faculty, where I study now concurrently with university.
